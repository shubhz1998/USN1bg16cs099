                 Adopt-a-Pet.com (formerly 1-800-Save-A-Pet.com) is North America's largest non-profit pet adoption website. 
                 We help over 17,000 animal shelters, humane societies, SPCAs, pet rescue groups, and pet adoption agencies advertise their homeless pets to millions of adopters a month, for free.
                  We're all about getting homeless pets into homes</p>

            <p style="font-family:verdana";>We use the power of the Internet to connect adopters with shelter pets and help pets go from alone to adopted. We're working to help the good people at shelters and rescue groups find homes for their pets. But we don't stop there. We also provide useful and informative information on the human/companion animal relationship to help keep pets healthy and permanently in their loving homes. Our blog has articles, and our YouTube channel has useful pet training as well as entertaining videos, all produced by our expert staff of professionals in animal training and behavior, as well as human psychology</p>
